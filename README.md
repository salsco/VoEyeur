# VoEyeur
A just-for-fun project to test my POMDPuzzle library. VoEyeur is an artificial agent whose purpose is to help the navigation of the user through webpages. It "spies" the navigation pattern of the user and then learns a policy based on its time-varying knowledge about page switching. It is absolutely not recommended to be used in production; as
above mentioned, it's scope is merely devoted to practice about POMDP and Artificial Agent Coding.
